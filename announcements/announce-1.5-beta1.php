<h4>
  Principal Improvements
</h4>
<p align="justify">
  The principal improvements over KOffice 1.4 are:
</p>
    <strong>General</strong>:
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>
        <div align="justify">
        <strong>OASIS OpenDocument as the Default File Format</strong>:

<p>
KOffice now uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument">OASIS OpenDocument</a> as the default file format for the productivity applications KWord, KSpread, and KPresenter.  In the final 1.5 release, the charting application KChart will also use OpenDocument as the default format.</p>
<p>
The spreading of the OpenDocument file format is widely regarded as one of the most important developments in the whole IT industry right now. It will give users world-wide the possibility to control their own documents and also ensure that all documents will always be possible to read at any time in the future.
</p>
<p>
KOffice was the first office suite that announced support for OpenDocument and now the second to announce it as the default file format after OpenOffice.org.  This makes KOffice a member of a very select group and will lead to new deployment opportunities.  Great care has been taken to ensure interoperability with other office software that also use OpenDocument.
</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div align="justify">
        <strong>Project Management Application KPlato</strong>:
<p>
KOffice 1.5 is the first official release to include KPlato. KPlato is a project management application that lets the user control project schedules and resource use. It is included in KOffice 1.5 as a technology preview and full functionality is expected for version 2.0.
</p>
<p>
With this release, KPlato already offers various charts (gantt, pert), scheduling capabilities, calendars, resources, tasks and subtasks, detecting critical paths and resources as well as generating a work breakdown structure. KPlato can also be embedded into other KOffice applications.
</p>
<p>
For a list of features supported by KPlato, see
 <a href="http://www.koffice.org/announcements/changelog-1.5beta1.php">the changelog</a>.
</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div align="justify">
        <strong>Enhanced Accessibility for Users with Disabilities</strong>:
<p>
The decision of the Commonwealth of Massachussetts to base its future document format on open standards started a great debate with many different people and organization taking part.  The start of it was Microsofts assertion that programs using the OpenDocument file format could not be used by people with disabilities.
</p>
<p>
The direct outcome of this debate was that OpenOffice.org, KOffice and vendors of other office software started to work hard on rectifying this problem.  This version of KOffice has support for enhanced accessibility through the means of mouseless operation and text-to-speech functionality.
</p>
<p>
It is therefore our hope that KOffice will be possible to use even for users with disabilities, and we are very interested in feedback for this.
</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div align="justify">
        <strong>Start of a Unified Scripting Approach.</strong>:
<p>
This version of KOffice features a start of a unified scripting solution called Kross. Kross provides cross-language support for scripting (thus its name) and at present supports Python and Ruby.
</p>
<p>
Kross is easy to include into programs previously lacking scripting abilities, and is included in this version as a technology preview. So far, only Krita and Kexi are enhanced with the Kross engine. We would also like to point out that the API might change in the future and expect Kross to be fully integrated for KOffice version 2.0.

<h4>
  Installing KOffice 1.5-beta Binary Packages
</h4>
<p align="justify">
  <strong>Binary Packages</strong>:
  Some Linux/UNIX OS vendors have kindly provided binary packages of
  KOffice 1.5 beta for some versions of their distribution, and in other cases
  community volunteers have done so.
  Some of these binary packages are available for free download from KDE's
  <a href="http://download.kde.org/unstable/koffice-1.5-beta/">http and ftp</a> mirrors.
  Additional binary packages, as well as updates to the packages now

</p>
<p align="justify">
  Please note that the KDE Project makes these packages available from the
  KDE web site as a convenience to KDE users.  The KDE Project is not
  responsible for these packages as they are provided by third
  parties - typically, but not always, the distributor of the relevant
  distribution - using tools, compilers, library versions and quality
  assurance procedures over which KDE exercises no control. If you
  cannot find a binary package for your OS, or you are displeased with
  the quality of binary packages available for your system, please read
  the <a href="http://www.kde.org/download/packagepolicy.php">KDE Binary Package
  Policy</a> and/or contact your OS vendor.
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <strong>Library Requirements / Options</strong>:
  The library requirements for a particular binary package vary with the
  system on which the package was compiled.  Please bear in mind that
  some binary packages may require a newer version of Qt and other libraries
  than was shipped with the system (e.g., LinuxDistro X.Y
  may have shipped with Qt-3.3.0 but the packages below may require
  Qt-3.3.2).  For general library requirements for KDE, please see the text at
  <a href="#source_code-library_requirements">Source Code - Library
  Requirements</a> below.

<h4>
  About KOffice/KDE
</h4>
<p align="justify">
  KOffice is part of the KDE Project.
  KDE is an independent project of hundreds of developers, translators,
  artists and professionals worldwide collaborating over the Internet
  to create and freely distribute a sophisticated, customizable and stable
  desktop and office environment employing a flexible, component-based,
  network-transparent architecture and offering an outstanding development
  platform.  KDE provides a stable, mature desktop, a full, component-based
  office suite (<a href="http://www.koffice.org/">KOffice</a>), a large
  set of networking and administration tools and utilities, and an
  efficient, intuitive development environment featuring the excellent IDE
  <a href="http://www.kdevelop.org/">KDevelop</a>.  KDE is working proof
  that the Open Source "Bazaar-style" software development model can yield
  first-rate technologies on par with and superior to even the most complex
  commercial software.
